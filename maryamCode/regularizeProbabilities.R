#' We assume that the posteriori probability for different status is uniform with probability regFactor and a probability computed based on the NB model with probability (1-regFactor)
#' regularize the probability table according to the mentioned assumption
#' @param probTable A non regularized prob table in which every row corresponds to a status and each column corresponds to a single cell
#' @param regFactor the regularization factor
